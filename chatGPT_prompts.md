Hi, I need to build a simple device to control an LED from a raspberry pi GPIO17 (pin 11). I need a python flask app that presents the user with a webpage and the webpage allows the user to turn the LED on or off.

    from flask import Flask, render_template_string, request
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

    # Setup GPIO
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
    GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.OUT)
    GPIO.output(17, GPIO.LOW)

    # Create Flask app
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
    def index():
        if request.method == "POST":
            action = request.form.get("action")
            if action == "on":
                GPIO.output(17, GPIO.HIGH)
            elif action == "off":
                GPIO.output(17, GPIO.LOW)

        # Read current LED state
        led_state = GPIO.input(17)
        return render_template_string(HTML_TEMPLATE, led_state=led_state)

    # Run the app
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        try:
            app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            GPIO.cleanup()
            print("\nGPIO cleanup and app stopped.")

**`Raspberry Pi Led Control`**

This Python Flask app includes the backend to control the LED connected to GPIO17. You'll also need a simple HTML file (index.html) to serve as the user interface. Would you like help creating the HTML file?

#### You said: ####
Yes! Could you integrate it into a single file?

    from flask import Flask, render_template_string, request
    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

    # Setup GPIO
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
    GPIO.setup(17, GPIO.OUT)
    GPIO.output(17, GPIO.LOW)

    # Create Flask app
    app = Flask(__name__)

    HTML_TEMPLATE = """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>LED Control</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Control the LED</h1>
        <p>LED is currently: <strong>{{ "ON" if led_state else "OFF" }}</strong></p>
        <form method="post">
            <button type="submit" name="action" value="on">Turn ON</button>
            <button type="submit" name="action" value="off">Turn OFF</button>
        </form>
    </body>
    </html>
    """

    @app.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
    def index():
        if request.method == "POST":
            action = request.form.get("action")
            if action == "on":
                GPIO.output(17, GPIO.HIGH)
            elif action == "off":
                GPIO.output(17, GPIO.LOW)

        # Read current LED state
        led_state = GPIO.input(17)
        return render_template_string(HTML_TEMPLATE, led_state=led_state)

    # Run the app
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        try:
            app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            GPIO.cleanup()
            print("\nGPIO cleanup and app stopped.")

The HTML template is now integrated into the Python script using render_template_string. You can run this single file, and it will provide the webpage to control the LED. Let me know if you need further assistance!

#### I saved the file as the original `wifi_flashlight_rpi` and ran it using `python3 wifi_flashlight_rpi` ####
Here is the commandline output:

and here is what the webpage looks like:

So, I went back to ChatGPT to add the other two LEDs.

#### You said: ####
That works great! Can you do me a favor? I'd like to have more than one LED. Can you add two more? One connected to GPIO27 and the other to GPIO22? They should all be controlled together with the same webpage.

I've added support for two additional LEDs connected to GPIO27 and GPIO22. The webpage now displays the states of all three LEDs and provides buttons to turn them all on or off simultaneously. Let me know if you need further modifications!

#### I saved the update on top of the original (`wifi_flashlight_rpi`) ####

When I ran it, the new interface looks like this:

![Screenshot](./doc/screenshots/v2_screenshot.png)

I don't like how it shows all 3 LEDs seperately, I would like them to function as a single light, even if I have them turn on and off a little staggered to provide a nice fade.

#### You said: ####

That's great. I have two more enhancements. Would you make it so the LEDs all fade on and off over 1/2 second or so whenever the state changes? Also, if possible could you make the center LED (GPIO 27) start turning on a fraction before the other two when it turns on, and when switched off, turn off GPIO27 that same fraction of a second after the other two? I think this would give it a nice fade effect.

Got it! Let me know when you'd like to continue or if there's anything else I can help you with. ðŸ˜Š

Actually, the document didn't update - it exceeded max length

The document exceeded the maximum length due to the added functionality. To address this issue, I will optimize the code and rewrite it while adhering to the requested enhancements. This version will ensure that all features fit within the allowed space.

I've updated and streamlined the code to ensure it incorporates all requested features while fitting within the constraints. The application now includes a fade effect for the LEDs and aligns with your specified behavior. Let me know if there are additional tweaks or enhancements you'd like to apply!

#### You Said: ####

Okay. I don't think I like the one LED fading before or after the others. Can we still make them all fade on and off over 1/2 second, but to do so together?

I've updated the code to make all LEDs fade on and off together over half a second, without staggering the timing for the center LED. Let me know if you need further adjustments or enhancements!

#### My Thoughts: ####

The interface (when it simplified the code) went back to where it doesn't show the 3 LEDs seperately. I like this more. 

I do need the system to use GET variables instead of post, and I want it to use "/led=on" and "/led=off" for the routes. I'm going to do that next.
