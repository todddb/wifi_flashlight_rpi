Hi, I need to build a simple device to control an LED from a raspberry pi GPIO17 (pin 11). I need a python flask app that presents the user with a webpage and the webpage allows the user to turn the LED on or off.

Raspberry Pi Led Control

This Python Flask app includes the backend to control the LED connected to GPIO17. You'll also need a simple HTML file (index.html) to serve as the user interface. Would you like help creating the HTML file?

Yes! Could you integrate it into a single file?

The HTML template is now integrated into the Python script using render_template_string. You can run this single file, and it will provide the webpage to control the LED. Let me know if you need further assistance!
